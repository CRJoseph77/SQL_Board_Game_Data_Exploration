# Exploring Board Game Recommendations Using SQL
Cleaning and exploring board game data from BoardGameGeek.com using SQL.

## Project Overview
Collecting and playing board games with others is one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy sharing fun experiences around the table with friends and family. 

Another element of the board game hobby is discovering and exploring new games to share with others. With the ever-increasing amount of board games published each year, it can be difficult to find games that fit the tastes and preferences of my game group. This project aims to use data from boardgamegeek.com to find game recommendations based on a variety of different factors (game complexity, player count, category, etc.). 

The boardgamegeek.com data was explored, cleaned, structured, and manipulated to discover highly ranked games that might be a good fit for me and the people I play games with. 

## Code and Resources Used
Editor Used: This project was created using Microsoftâ€™s SQL Server Management Studio 19.

## Data
1. Source data: The data originally comes from a popular board game reference site, boardgamegeek.com. The two relevant datasets for this project are the [games.csv](games.csv) dataset and the [mechanics.csv](mechanics.csv) dataset.

2. Acquisition: The boardgamegeek.com data used for this project was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/threnjen/board-games-database-from-boardgamegeek).
  
3. Preprocessing: No preprocessing was performed prior to importing the CSV files into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. During the process of importing, column data types were automatically detected. A few of them had to be inspected to ensure that numbers were being treated as integers or floats and that strings were being interpreted properly as strings. 

## SQL Code
1. Data exploration - The first part of this project involves getting a better understanding of what is going on in the data, including examining any apparent anomalies found in the data. A basic plan was developed for data cleaning and joining based on discoveries made during data exploration.
   
2. Data cleaning and structuring - Next, the data was copied into a second table for cleaning. Data was filtered for only relevant rows and columns, and those columns were cleaned by checking for duplicates, dealing with a few missing values, fixing/removing irrelevant or erroneous data, and creating new columns with transformed/aggregated values.

3. Joining data - Once the data was cleaned and cleaning was validated, the two tables of interest were joined together.

4. Further data exploration - Data exploration was performed on the clean data to investigate highly ranked games based on the different metrics of interest. The data was grouped, filtered, and organized to identify games that meet certain criteria. Other tables and columns were created to further explore the data.

5. Creating stored procedures - Lastly, two stored procedures were created to filter the data based on certain specifications. The first returns all games that contain a specified keyword in their description. The second returns all games that work at a specified player count within a specified weight range. 


## Results
An exploration of the BoardGameGeek.com data allowed me to successfully identify multiple games that may be a good fit for my group based on multiple different metrics such as year published, player count, play time, game weight, and other factors. I also was able to gain insight into how games are ranked and rated based on their complexity, with higher-weight games generally being ranked and rated more favorably. I was also able to identify which games might be a good fit for me based on the mechanisms I enjoy. Finally, I was able to create stored procedures that return game recommendations based on specified keywords in the game description or player count and game weight.
