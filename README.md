## Project Overview
Collecting and playing board games with others is one of my favorite hobbies. I enjoy sharing fun experiences around the table with friends and family. 

Another element of the board game hobby is discovering and exploring new games to share with others. With the ever-increasing amount of board games published each year, it can be difficult to find games that fit the tastes and preferences of my game group. This project aims to use data from boardgamegeek.com to find game recommendations based on a variety of different factors (game complexity, player count, category, etc.). 

The boardgamegeek.com data was explored, cleaned, structured, and manipulated to discover highly ranked games that might be a good fit for me and the people I play games with.
